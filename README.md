# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Project

- by: Febi Febriyanti Salina Berutu

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing decision trees and linear regression, using real-world datasets. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these models and understand their applications. 
The project is divided into two parts:
1. Decision Trees: Analysis using a penguin dataset to classify different species of penguins based on their physical measurements.
2. Linear Regression: Analysis using a housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features.

## How to Run the Project on Local
### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/febifebriyantisb/Supervised-Unsupervised-Learning.git
   cd Supervised-Unsupervised-Learning
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Running the Notebooks
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open the notebook file:**
   - Navigate to ` Decision Trees/Sklearn_Decision_Tree_Penguin.ipynb` and `Linear Regression/SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb` in your browser and open them.

## Project Highlights
1. **Decision Trees:** Implementation and visualization of decision trees using the penguin dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Linear Regression:** Implementation and analysis of simple linear regression using the housing dataset. The notebook covers data exploration, model fitting, and interpretation of results.
